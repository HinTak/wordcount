This is a small demo program I wrote to expose wc
through a mini-web-server.

(c) 2017 Hin-Tak Leung.

Usage
=====

Launch the server as (any number larger than 1024):

    python ./wc-mini-web-server.py 7642

and point your browser at:

    http://localhost:7642

You would be given a form to upload a file. Once you click
"Upload File", you would get essentially the same output.
